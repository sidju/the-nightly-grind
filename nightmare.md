# Nightmare

#powers-of-the-blood

### 1: Dread Presence

You can exude an aura of fear, disconcerting everyone around you and making it
seem like a bad idea to displease you.

### 1: Vision of Fear

You can project a terrifying illusion into the minds of those nearby with less
[Mental Ability](mental-ability.md) than you. It is a short glimmers of a feared
possibility, of blood slowly pouring out where your hand should be, of a maimed
loved one dead on the floor. The illusion must be horrifying and you can freely
choose multiple targets to try to project it to.

### 2: Face of the Beast

You can fill a targets mind with immense fear, forcing those with less
[Mental Ability](mental-ability.md) to flee from your presence and making even
those who resist shy away from you for a few minutes.

### 2: Haunting

You can embed a raw formless fear into the mind of a target with less
[Mental Ability](mental-ability.md) than you, making them feel a disconcerted and
worried as long as the effect persists. It affects kindred for the rest of the
night, but humans are affected for a week and will struggle to sleep at all in
that time.

### 3: Waking Nightmare

You cast a target with less [Mental Ability](mental-ability.md) than you into a
nightmarish illusion of your making. You can freely control what of their
surroundings they see and what you show them instead, but the longer they look
the more unsettling things become, even things that are real warp into horror.
These illusions persist as long as you are there to maintain them.

### 3: Mortal Terror

You can wield fear so potent it causes physical harm. Even a target with
more [Mental Ability](mental-ability.md) than you freezes in terror, and those
with less feel their heart stop as the fear tears into their body dealing
one damage for every three points of [Mental Ability](mental-ability.md) you
have.
