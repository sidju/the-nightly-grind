# Mental Ability

Mental ability defines your ability to win mental challenges. It covers both
willpower and whatever mental techniques may help in a mental challenge.

This isn't related to intelligence, if anything it relates to wisdom and
self-confidence.

Animals may have a Mental Ability of 1 or 2, possibly 3 in exceptional cases.

Human Mental Ability varies with their mental well-being between 1 and 6.
