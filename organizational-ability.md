# Organizational Ability

Organizational ability defines your ability to organize a larger sphere of
influence. Every investment you control must be managed, this describes how many
you can directly handle. This stat is considered to include both innate and
technical aspects. Note that you can directly control one fewer investment per
point of [Blood Potency](blood-potency.md).

Humans have an Organizational Ability between 1 and 3, normally 1.

You may supplant Organizational Ability using one or more ghouls, who are then
nearly fully booked managing those investments and thus add their Organizational
Ability to yours.
