## Gaining XP

You have a starting amount of XP based on your character's age, see
[Character Creation](character-creation.md) for details.

During play a character gains 6 XP at the end of every season of play,
to represent what they have learned during that season.


## Using XP

At the start of a season you can use your character's XP to buy new abilities.
The prices for them can be seen in the following table:

| Stat                                                | XP cost   |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| [Physical Ability](physical-ability.md)             | 4         |
| [Mental Ability](mental-ability.md)                 | 4         |
| [Organizational Ability](organizational-ability.md) | 4         |
| [HP](hp.md)                                         | 3         |
| [Humanity](humanity.md)                             | 7         |
| [Lore](lore.md)                                     | 3         |
| Any [Influence](influence.md)                       | 4         |

XP costs for powers increase for each level, and Clan powers are significantly
cheaper than others.

| [Clan](clans.md) [Powers](powers-of-the-blood.md) | XP cost |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Level 1                                           | 9       |
| Level 2                                           | 12      |
| Level 3                                           | 18      |

(`3 * (2 + 2 ^ (level - 1) )`)

| Other [Powers](powers-of-the-blood.md) | XP cost |
| -------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Level 1                                | 12      |
| Level 2                                | 18      |
| Level 3                                | 30      |

(`3 * (2 + 2 ^ level)`)


(An option is making Other Powers just cost 3 extra, but I like the way that
these costs encourage you to not reach level 3 outside of Clan Powers)
