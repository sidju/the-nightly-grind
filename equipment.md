# Equipment

## Armor

Armor provides some extra [HP](hp.md) that is used up before your own, at the cost of
being increasingly obvious.

| HP bonus | Category description   |
|----------|------------------------|
| \+ 2     | Discrete armored vest  |
| \+ 4     | Thick armored vest     |
| \+ 6     | Modern full-body armor |
| \+ 8     | Medieval full plate    |

## Melee weapons

Melee weapons provide a *Weapon Bonus* to your [Physical Ability](physical-ability.md) when used, which
may increase damage but isn't sure to do so.

| Weapon bonus | Category description | Example weapons      |
|--------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| \+ 1         | Easy to hide/explain | Knife, Walking stick |
| \+ 2         | Possible to hide     | Sword, Axe, Mace     |
| \+ 3         | Impossible to hide   | Huge sword, signpost |

## Ranged weapons

Ranged weapons simply deal a fix damage and are rarely as lethal as a melee
combatant, but for those unwilling to enter / lacking Physical Ability to be
efficient in melee it is something. Note that weapons deal double damage if the target is within close range, so for a risk quite good damage can be had.

Ranged weapons require that the user is proficient with the weapon.

| Weapon            | Damage | Special rules                        |
|-------------------|--------|--------------------------------------|
| Handgun           | 1      | Can be used in melee                 |
| Hunting rifle     | 2      |                                      |
| Assault rifle     | 2      |                                      |
| Sniper rifle      | 2      | Longer range, GM discretion          |
| Shotgun           | 3      | Cannot be reloaded in combat         |
| Sawed-off Shotgun | 3      | Can be used in melee, 2 shots/combat |

Sounds of gunfire could cause trouble, silencers can be used and have no impact
on damage.
