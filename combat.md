# Combat

Combat is structured into [Combat Rounds](#combat-rounds), where each round
allows each side to act in order of [Initiative](#initiative).

To understand this you should be familiar with the base concepts of:

- [Taking damage](#taking-damage)
- [Melee damage](#melee-damage)
- [Ranged damage](#ranged-damage)

Combat is a true battle where characters deal damage to each other, for
non-lethal duels or brawls instead refer to the [Brawl rules](brawl.md) which
cover such cases better.


## Initiative

To decide an initiative order use the following rules in order:

- If the attacker surprised the defender (less than 2 seconds from realization
  to attack): attacker goes first.
- If any side has more Celerity (total), they go first.
- If one party has more Physical Ability, they go first.
- If everything else ties, flip a coin or play rock-paper-scissors over it.

There is no bonus damage dealt on surprise attacks, Initiative is deemed a large
enough advantage.


## Combat Rounds

When your turn comes up in a round you can *move* once and do one of the
following:

- Melee attack, if your target is within reach.
- Ranged attack, if you aren't in melee.
- Use a discipline, if it is usable in a rush.


## Melee damage

Melee damage = (Physical Ability + Weapon Bonus (if any)) / 3 (round down) + level of Potence


## Ranged damage


### Close range damage

Weapon damage * 2


### Long range damage

Weapon damage * 1
