# Zettelkästen notes
#zettelkästen

This is a linked repository of assorted notes. They are somewhat navigable from
this file via links, but are best browsed with a dedicated tool or as a
generated page, so that backlinks and tags are browseable.


## Recommended tools

These are the tools I'd recommend for browsing and potentially editing this
zettelkästen. If your [Zettelkästen tool philosophy](ztool-philosophy.md)
matches mine I'd further recommend them for your own notes.

- `md-wiki`, my minimal static wiki generator. This repo is tailored for it and
  vice versa.
- `zk`, a very flexible CLI search and organization tool. Is very configurable
  and thus well supports an agnostic zettelkästen workflow.
