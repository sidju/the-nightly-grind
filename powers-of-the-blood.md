# Powers of the Blood

## Inherent

These are the powers all kindred possess and instinctively know how to use.

### The Kiss

Though it is possible to violently bite or cut a victim and drink from the wound
most kindred prefer to use the more discrete Kiss. With intent and a careful
bite the victim feels pleasure rather than pain from the bite, and the wound
furthermore seals itself without trace afterwards allowing the victim to be
blissfully ignorant of what happened. The pleasant sensation only affects
mundane creatures and kindred with less Blood Potency than the one biting.

### Blush of Life

At the cost of vitae you can be indistinguishable from humans. While active your
body has all natural functions of the human body one would expect, you can even
eat and drink as though human (but anything but blood will be violently ejected
when Blush of Life ends).

### Taste for Blood

You can discern a lot from a droplet of blood:

- If animal, human or supernatural.
- If you are familiar with it, the clan it came from.
- How "stale" it is.
- If it is closely connected to another droplet of blood you've tasted.

### Strike out with the Beast

Via a corresponding act you can push your beast upon a victim, affecting their
mind with its primal urges. You can choose which bestial aspect to project from
the following:

- Bestial, threaten or challenge them aggressively while your beast forces them
  to think in terms of fight or flight.
- Impulsive, offer or encourage them to something while your beast makes them
  want to act quickly and think less of consequences.
- Competitive, challenge their skill or honor while your beast encourages them
  to prove themselves and show off.

On kindred this manifests as a push in that direction, for humans it has a more
forceful impact.

## Animalism

### 1: Bestial Sympathy

Animals are more comfortable around you than other kindred, they can somewhat
understand your perspective and you theirs.

### 1: Feral Whispers

You can speak to animals and supernaturally convince them to do your bidding.

### 2: Summon the Hunt

You can make a splash of your blood the strongest of bait, for all carnivore
animals or one specific species. The effect remains until consumed or sunrise.

### 2: Raise the Familiar

You can make your blood able to raise a recently dead animal to a state of
undeath. They are similar to kindred but can only be sustained on vitae, and
the wounds that killed them remain visible.

### 3: Feral Infection

You can spill your blood and through it spread your beast through your
surroundings, whipping animals and humans into a rage. Supernatural creatures
can resist if they have higher Blood Potency than you, but if they have
imbibed your blood your Blood Potency counts as 2 higher. Those frenzied by
this are to some extent under your command, you can direct them towards a
target or a group. If you don't they will fight internally.

### 3: Lord of the Land

You can mark territory by encircling it with marks of vitae. This grants you
control of the given territory for one week per Blood Potency, though you can
freely maintain in while within. Unless invited, creatures within feel a deep
dread and urge to flee the area and will struggle to remain. You are
instinctively aware of creatures entering the territory, only blind to those
hidden by [Obfuscate](#obfuscate). Within this area you can see through the
eyes of animal blood servants and act through them, though limited by their
body.
If territories conflict the one with higher Blood Potency takes precedence.

## Auspex

### 1: Uncanny Perception

You can perceive primary emotions.

### 1: The Beast's Hackles

Your beast senses when something is wrong, when someone or something big is
hidden, but cannot tell you what. It exhibits as a feeling of being watched or
a sense of deja-vu.

### 2: The Spirit's Touch

By touching your victim you can more deeply read their thoughts, allowing you
to tell the reason for their primary emotion OR if they have lied to you in
this conversation.

### 2: See the Unseen

Your senses can pierce some illusions. For example you can see through level 1
Obfuscation and level 2 *if* weakened by movement, very recent interaction with
the environment (such as opening a door) or pointed out to you.

### 3: Lay Open the Mind

You restructure your thoughts until they align with your target, allowing a
quick touch to create a link to their mind. This link allows communication both
ways and makes it possible for you to try to overwhelm their mind and possibly
to reveal suppressed memories.

### 3: Pierce the Veil

Your senses can pierce most illusions. For example you can see through level 2
Obfuscation and level 3 *if* weakened by movement, very recent interaction with
the environment (such as opening a door) or pointed out to you.


## Celerity

### Passive effect

For each level of Celerity your reaction speed improves, allowing you to react
in-time with anyone using the same level. This means you are likely to win [Initiative](combat.md#initiative) in combat.

### Active effect

You can burn blood to act extremely quickly, granting you 5 seconds per level
of Celerity to act before the world starts moving again. This enables you to
escape from a Combat unless an opponent has equal or higher level of Celerity
and is thus able to chase you.

## Dominate

### 1: Request

With eye contact and a soft request you bind a target with less
[Mental Ability](mental-ability.md) than you, making them subconsciously inclined to fulfil it.
Kindred spontaneously fulfil small requests, thinking it was of their
own volition. Mortals are willing to do up to an hours work for you.

### 1: Command

If you have more [Mental Ability](#mental-ability) than your target and eye
contact you bind them, forcing them to obey a short command. Supernatural
creatures notice that you did something to them, but even so cannot resist
and compulsively obey. Mortals will make up explanations for their actions
and take any statement you give as an absolute truth, reshaping their view
of events and the world to make sense with your command.

### 2: Mesmerize

With eye contact you can place a target with less
[Mental Ability](mental-ability.md) than you into a suggestible hypnotic state.
While in this state the don't remember what they are told, but they will obey.
They can be given a long and complex task taking up to a night. They will feel
compelled to follow the instructions, but kindred can resist them if obeying
would be immediately dangerous. A typical use is ordering a human to "Follow me,
obey my orders and forget everything at sunrise.".

### 2: Entombed Command

Through [Mesmerize](#2:-Mesmerize) you can give a target a specific triggering
circumstance and a [Command](#command) to obey when those circumstances arise.
A typical use might be "If you hear someone plotting against me, *inform me*.".
The effect lasts for one night on kindred and one week on humans.

### 3: Decree

You can issue a loud and clear decree, all directly spoken to by you who have less
[Mental Ability](#mental-ability) than you can be affected by any other Dominate
power you choose. You need to clearly decree the effect it should have, affected
targets don't remember what you have said while those unaffected do. Example:
"Don't speak to Jonah tonight.", those affected strongly feel like not doing it
while those unaffected instead heard the order.

### 3: Forgetful Mind

You are powerful enough to change the memories of supernatural creatures. This
can both be done as a simple but possibly large change via [Command](#command) or as a more
detailed change via [Mesmerize](#mesmerize).

## Fortitude

### Combat

In combat Fortitude negates 1 damage per level per combat round. Furthermore you
can ignore aggravated damage for as many rounds as you have Fortitude, taking it
as normal damage (reduced by Fortitude as usual).

### Utility

Fortitude allows you to resist even mental assault, when defending treat your
[Mental Ability](mental-ability.md) as 2 higher for every level in Fortitude.

## Nightmare

### 1: Dread Presence

You can exude an aura of fear, disconcerting everyone around you and making it
seem like a bad idea to displease you.

### 1: Vision of Fear

You can project a terrifying illusion into the minds of those nearby with less
[Mental Ability](mental-ability.md) than you. It is a short glimmers of a feared
possibility, of blood slowly pouring out where your hand should be, of a maimed
loved one dead on the floor. The illusion must be horrifying and you can freely
choose multiple targets to try to project it to.

### 2: Face of the Beast

You can fill a targets mind with immense fear, forcing those with less
[Mental Ability](mental-ability.md) to flee from your presence and making even
those who resist shy away from you for a few minutes.

### 2: Haunting

You can embed a raw formless fear into the mind of a target with less
[Mental Ability](mental-ability.md) than you, making them feel a disconcerted and
worried as long as the effect persists. It affects kindred for the rest of the
night, but humans are affected for a week and will struggle to sleep at all in
that time.

### 3: Waking Nightmare

You cast a target with less [Mental Ability](#mental-ability) than you into a
nightmarish illusion of your making. You can freely control what of their
surroundings they see and what you show them instead, but the longer they look
the more unsettling things become, even things that are real warp into horror.
These illusions persist as long as you are there to maintain them.

### 3: Mortal Terror

You can wield fear so potent it causes physical harm. Even a target with
more [Mental Ability](#mental-ability) than you freezes in terror, and those
with less feel their heart stop as the fear tears into their body dealing
one damage for every three points of [Mental Ability](#mental-ability) you
have.

## Obfuscation

Obfuscation is a mental effect projected into the minds of those that perceive
you. As such it covers all senses, but a picture will reveal you in full detail
if someone looks at it when you are not there or not projecting the effect.

### 1: Cloak of Night

You can sweep disinterest around you so firmly your aren't even noticed, people
will walk around you without thinking anything of it. Those who have already
noticed you will however still perceive you.

### 1: Secret Missive

You can bestow any effect of Obfuscation onto an object or animal no
larger than a large dog, the effect persists until sunrise.

### 2: Mask of a Thousand Faces

You have full control of how you are perceived and can choose between being
fully unseen, appearing nondescript or looking exactly like someone specific.

### 2: Touch of Shadow

You can bestow any effect of Obfuscation onto an object or animal no larger
than a minibus, the effect persists until sunrise.

### 3: Cloak the Gathering

You can extend your control of how people perceive you to others through
touch, by holding onto them when hiding your presence you can hide them.
You can hide one target beyond yourself per 3 [Mental Ability](#mental-ability).
Those you are directly holding with your hands are hidden at level 2 of
Obfuscation, those holding onto you are hidden at level 1 of Obfuscation.

### 3: Oubliette

By marking its border with vitae you can claim a domain, hiding it from
mundane senses and controlling what those within can perceive. It remains in
your control for one week per Blood Potency.

## Potence

### Combat

Potence lets you deal 1 extra damage per level of potence per round of combat.

### Utility

Potence enables you to perform feats of inhuman strength, the more potence the
more extreme.

## Presence

### 1: Awe

You can awe everyone who sees you, turning eyes to you and making what you say
weigh a little heavier than otherwise.

### 1: Shame

You can turn your charm against another, shaming them for something. If they have
less [Mental Ability](#mental-ability) than you they will feel guilty and
ashamed even if what you shamed them for was nonsense. "If you said it it must
be true."

### 2: Confidant

With a deep gaze you can charm a target with less
[Mental Ability](#mental-ability) than you to think of you as a trustworthy and
kind, making them more likely to entrust you with their secrets.

### 2: Obsession

With a touch you can embed an obsession in a target with less
[Mental Ability](#mental-ability) than you which remains for a week. Kindred
will think of you a few times per night, but there is no guarantee they will
think fondly of you, while humans generally think themselves to be in love and
can easily be manipulated to do anything that doesn't directly harm them.

### 3: Majesty

You can radiate such incredible awe that those in your presence with less
[Mental Ability](#mental-ability) than you cannot act beyond bowing to your
greatness or scurrying away.

### 3: Loyalty

You can inspire a deep and burning loyalty in a target with less
[Mental Ability](mental-ability.md) than you. Kindred see you as their liege and
are as loyal as a kindred can be for the night, humans are fully loyal for a
week and willing to give anything including their life to please you.

## Protean

### 1: Unmarked Grave

With a silent command you allow the earth to put you where you belong, six feet
under. You meld into the ground, safe from harm and sun, and remain there until
you spend some vitae to be released or someone sufficiently disturbs the ground
to end the effect. This is most easily done on softer ground, but even concrete
can be melded into at the cost of needing to spend all vitae to be released.
You can perceive the ground immediately above and blood or vitae spilled on the
ground can be absorbed without coming out.

### 1: Predatory Aspect

You allow the beast to slip through your very form, making an animalistic
change to your shape that makes you better suited to hunt in the night. Typical
changes are senses, mundane claws, hardy skin/armor, quadrupedal limbs or
patagia (gliding skin). The change cannot be reverted, they revert naturally at
sunrise or can be cut off and the damage healed to return to normal. A new
change cannot be chosen while another is in effect.

### 2: Predatory Form

By consuming a primarily meat- or blood-eating animal to death you become able
to take its form subsequent nights. You can remember one form per 3
[Mental Ability](mental-ability.md), adding a new one beyond these requires
discarding one of the old ones. The transformation is a violent process of
cracking bones and cramp-like movements that folds you down until you reach
the form, it is painful but not excessively and not harmful.

### 2: Horrid Aspect

You allow even more of the beast to slip through your form, be it animal or
human, corrupting it with a horrifying supernatural aspect. Typical changes
are supernaturally harmful claws/teeth or wings capable of flight.

### 3: Primal Miasma

You release the trappings of your mundane form and evaporate into a cloud of
hungry mist. You can perceive everything inside your smoke and are immune to
all damage except fire and sunlight. You can remain in this form through
day-sleep. You can drink blood open to the air (open wounds/containers) which
seems to evaporate and disappear into thin air, but you cannot cause any
damage.

### 3: Horrid Form

You allow the beast to fully shape you, taking on a monstrous form unique to
you. This form is what your beast perceives as the perfect predator, usually
including expanded senses, faster movement and greater ability in combat.
The transformation swells and elongates you, and when you wish it reverts
and seemingly deflates you into your normal form.
