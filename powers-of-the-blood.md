# Powers of the Blood

## Inherent

These are the powers all kindred possess and instinctively know how to use.

### The Kiss

Though it is possible to violently bite or cut a victim and drink from the wound
most kindred prefer to use the more discrete Kiss. With intent and a careful
bite the victim feels pleasure rather than pain from the bite, and the wound
furthermore seals itself without trace afterwards allowing the victim to be
blissfully ignorant of what happened. The pleasant sensation only affects
mundane creatures and kindred with less Blood Potency than the one biting.

### Blush of Life

At the cost of vitae you can be indistinguishable from humans. While active your
body has all natural functions of the human body one would expect, you can even
eat and drink as though human (but anything but blood will be violently ejected
when Blush of Life ends).

### Taste for Blood

You can discern a lot from a droplet of blood:

- If animal, human or supernatural.
- If you are familiar with it, the clan it came from.
- How "stale" it is.
- If it is closely connected to another droplet of blood you've tasted.

### Strike out with the Beast

Via a corresponding act you can push your beast upon a victim, affecting their
mind with its primal urges. You can choose which bestial aspect to project from
the following:

- Bestial, threaten or challenge them aggressively while your beast forces them
  to think in terms of fight or flight.
- Impulsive, offer or encourage them to something while your beast makes them
  want to act quickly and think less of consequences.
- Competitive, challenge their skill or honor while your beast encourages them
  to prove themselves and show off.

On kindred this manifests as a push in that direction, for humans it has a more
forceful impact.
