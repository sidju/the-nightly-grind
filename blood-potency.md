# Blood Potency (BP)

#rules

Blood Potency is the strength of your vampiric blood. A higher blood potency
enables you to have more ghouls, use multiple disciplines at once, endure more
damage and heal faster.

- You can have two ghouls per Blood Potency point.
- You can use one discipline per 2 blood points at the same time, so 2 at BP 3.
- You gain 5 peak HP per BP.
- Your healing rate is multiplied by your BP.
- Your damage from [Banes](banes.md) is multiplied by your BP.
- BP makes you wake later and go to sleep earlier (reduces Organizational
  Ability by 2 for each BP).
