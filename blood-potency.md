# Blood Potency (BP)

#rules

Blood Potency is the strength of your vampiric blood. A higher blood potency
enables you to have more ghouls, use multiple disciplines at once, endure more
damage and heal faster.


## Effects

- You can have two ghouls per Blood Potency point.
- You can use one discipline per 2 blood points at the same time, so 2 at BP 3.
- You gain 6 peak HP per BP.
- Your healing rate is multiplied by your BP.
- Your damage from [Banes](banes.md) is multiplied by your BP.
- Every BP beyond the first makes you sleep one hour more per day (reduces
  Organizational Ability by 2 for each BP beyond 1).


## Gaining Blood Potency

Your blood potency rises by one approximately every 24 years of vampiric
existence. When a character is within 10 years of such a point you get to roll
for raising their blood potency, the odds of success increase each year until
they are guaranteed to raise it.

Years spent in torpor count against raising a character's blood potency by, one
year in torpor negates one year of vampiric existence.

This equates to the following table:

| Years of existence - years of torpor | Blood Potency |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| 0 -> 14                              | 1             |
| 14 -> 24                             | 1 or 2        |
| 24 -> 38                             | 2             |
| 38 -> 48                             | 2 or 3        |
| 48 -> 62                             | 3             |
| 62 -> 72                             | 3 or 4        |
| 72 -> 86                             | 4             |
| 86 -> 96                             | 4 or 5        |
| 96 -> 110                            | 5             |
| 110 -> 120                           | 5 or 6        |
