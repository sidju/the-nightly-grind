### 1: Request

With eye contact and a soft request you bind a target with less
[Mental Ability](mental-ability.md) than you, making them subconsciously inclined to fulfil it.
Kindred spontaneously fulfil small requests, thinking it was of their
own volition. Mortals are willing to do up to an hours work for you.

### 1: Command

If you have more [Mental Ability](#mental-ability) than your target and eye
contact you bind them, forcing them to obey a short command. Supernatural
creatures notice that you did something to them, but even so cannot resist
and compulsively obey. Mortals will make up explanations for their actions
and take any statement you give as an absolute truth, reshaping their view
of events and the world to make sense with your command.

### 2: Mesmerize

With eye contact you can place a target with less
[Mental Ability](mental-ability.md) than you into a suggestible hypnotic state.
While in this state the don't remember what they are told, but they will obey.
They can be given a long and complex task taking up to a night. They will feel
compelled to follow the instructions, but kindred can resist them if obeying
would be immediately dangerous. A typical use is ordering a human to "Follow me,
obey my orders and forget everything at sunrise.".

### 2: Entombed Command

Through [Mesmerize](#2:-Mesmerize) you can give a target a specific triggering
circumstance and a [Command](#command) to obey when those circumstances arise.
A typical use might be "If you hear someone plotting against me, *inform me*.".
The effect lasts for one night on kindred and one week on humans.

### 3: Decree

You can issue a loud and clear decree, all directly spoken to by you who have less
[Mental Ability](#mental-ability) than you can be affected by any other Dominate
power you choose. You need to clearly decree the effect it should have, affected
targets don't remember what you have said while those unaffected do. Example:
"Don't speak to Jonah tonight.", those affected strongly feel like not doing it
while those unaffected instead heard the order.

### 3: Forgetful Mind

You are powerful enough to change the memories of supernatural creatures. This
can both be done as a simple but possibly large change via [Command](#command) or as a more
detailed change via [Mesmerize](#mesmerize).
