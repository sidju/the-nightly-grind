# Character Creation

Follow the instructions below to fill in a
[character sheet](character-sheet.md#example-sheet).


## Background info

Enter:

- name,
- human/visual age,
- date of embrace,
- clan and
- years spent in torpor

Note that though it is possible for your time in torpor to increase, these
values are expected to remain unchanged throughout the characters life.


## Stats Foundation

Character creation begins with a simple rule, all characters with supernatural
essence in them have the highest humanly possible value for every stat. Those
values are:

| Stat                                                     | value |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| [HP](hp.md)                                              | 6     |
| [Mental Ability (MA)](mental-ability.md)                 | 6     |
| [Physical Ability (PA)](physical-ability.md)             | 6     |
| [Organizational Ability (OA)](organizational-ability.md) | 3     |


## Humanity

Humans are [Humanity](humanity.md) 7, but supernatural existence quickly
drains that out of most characters. Look at the [Humanity page](humanity.md)
and choose the level you think your character is likely to have stopped their
descent at, or possibly reclaimed after a further fall.


## Blood Potency

[Blood Potency](blood-potency.md) is nearly fully defined by age. See the
[Gaining Blood Potency section](blood-potency.md#gaining-blood-potency).

Then apply the [Effects of Blood Potency](blood-potency.md#effects) on your
character's stats before proceeding.


## Loose XP

Finally you are free to spend XP based on your characters age. Especially
note the the unique choices you can use to shape your character:

- [Influence](influence.md)
- [Powers](powers-of-the-blood.md)

Characters gain 2 XP per active year of existence. View the
[XP page](xp.md#using-xp) for what you can spend it on.


## Calculated values

Finally when you have all your stats you are recommended to note down your
maximal damage output and what kind of weapon is required to raise it by 1.

You can deal one damage per 3 [PA](physical-ability.md) (divide by 3, round
down) + one per level of [Potence](potence.md). Note down that number as your
"Damage".

As you calculated damage from [PA](physical-ability.md) you probably noted that
you would need another 1 to 3 PA to raise your damage by 1, that number is the
"Significant Weapon Bonus". If you use a weapon that provides that bonus or
higher you deal one extra damage per round.

These in structions in shorter form are also written in the
[character sheet page](character-sheet.md).
