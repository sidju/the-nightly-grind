### 1: Unmarked Grave

With a silent command you allow the earth to put you where you belong, six feet
under. You meld into the ground, safe from harm and sun, and remain there until
you spend some vitae to be released or someone sufficiently disturbs the ground
to end the effect. This is most easily done on softer ground, but even concrete
can be melded into at the cost of needing to spend all vitae to be released.
You can perceive the ground immediately above and blood or vitae spilled on the
ground can be absorbed without coming out.

### 1: Predatory Aspect

You allow the beast to slip through your very form, making an animalistic
change to your shape that makes you better suited to hunt in the night. Typical
changes are senses, mundane claws, hardy skin/armor, quadrupedal limbs or
patagia (gliding skin). The change cannot be reverted, they revert naturally at
sunrise or can be cut off and the damage healed to return to normal. A new
change cannot be chosen while another is in effect.

### 2: Predatory Form

By consuming a primarily meat- or blood-eating animal to death you become able
to take its form subsequent nights. You can remember one form per 3
[Mental Ability](mental-ability.md), adding a new one beyond these requires
discarding one of the old ones. The transformation is a violent process of
cracking bones and cramp-like movements that folds you down until you reach
the form, it is painful but not excessively and not harmful.

### 2: Horrid Aspect

You allow even more of the beast to slip through your form, be it animal or
human, corrupting it with a horrifying supernatural aspect. Typical changes
are supernaturally harmful claws/teeth or wings capable of flight.

### 3: Primal Miasma

You release the trappings of your mundane form and evaporate into a cloud of
hungry mist. You can perceive everything inside your smoke and are immune to
all damage except fire and sunlight. You can remain in this form through
day-sleep. You can drink blood open to the air (open wounds/containers) which
seems to evaporate and disappear into thin air, but you cannot cause any
damage.

### 3: Horrid Form

You allow the beast to fully shape you, taking on a monstrous form unique to
you. This form is what your beast perceives as the perfect predator, usually
including expanded senses, faster movement and greater ability in combat.
The transformation swells and elongates you, and when you wish it reverts
and seemingly deflates you into your normal form.
