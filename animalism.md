#powers-of-the-blood

### 1: Bestial Sympathy

Animals are more comfortable around you than other kindred, they can somewhat
understand your perspective and you theirs.

### 1: Feral Whispers

You can speak to animals and supernaturally convince them to do your bidding.

### 2: Summon the Hunt

You can make a splash of your blood the strongest of bait, for all carnivore
animals or one specific species. The effect remains until consumed or sunrise.

### 2: Raise the Familiar

You can make your blood able to raise a recently dead animal to a state of
undeath. They are similar to kindred but can only be sustained on vitae, and
the wounds that killed them remain visible.

### 3: Feral Infection

You can spill your blood and through it spread your beast through your
surroundings, whipping animals and humans into a rage. Supernatural creatures
can resist if they have higher Blood Potency than you, but if they have
imbibed your blood your Blood Potency counts as 2 higher. Those frenzied by
this are to some extent under your command, you can direct them towards a
target or a group. If you don't they will fight internally.

### 3: Lord of the Land

You can mark territory by encircling it with marks of vitae. This grants you
control of the given territory for one week per Blood Potency, though you can
freely maintain in while within. Unless invited, creatures within feel a deep
dread and urge to flee the area and will struggle to remain. You are
instinctively aware of creatures entering the territory, only blind to those
hidden by [Obfuscate](obfuscation.md). Within this area you can see through the
eyes of animal blood servants and act through them, though limited by their
body.
If territories conflict the one with higher Blood Potency takes precedence.
