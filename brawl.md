# Brawl

A brawl is a harmless alternative to [Combat](combat.md). Instead of rounds and
dealing damage, just compare Physical Ability between the sides (with Weapon
bonus if weapons are used) and the higher number wins. No disciplines are
allowed.

This can be considered to be something like a duel to first blood or wrestling,
where both physical ability and technical skill defines the winner.


It is possible to add in disciplines using the following bonus table:

| Discipline | Bonus   |
|------------|---------|
| Fortitude  | 1/level |
