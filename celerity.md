# Celerity

#powers-of-the-blood

### Passive effect

For each level of Celerity your reaction speed improves, allowing you to react
in-time with anyone using the same level. This means you are likely to win [Initiative](combat.md#initiative) in combat.

### Active effect

You can burn blood to act extremely quickly, granting you 5 seconds per level
of Celerity to act before the world starts moving again. This enables you to
escape from a Combat unless an opponent has equal or higher level of Celerity
and is thus able to chase you.
