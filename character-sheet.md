# Character Sheet breakdown

#index #rules

This page explains all values that normally appear on a character sheet.
(And contains a simple example character sheet at the bottom.)


## HP

HP is the classical stat for how much damage a character is able to endure
before falling in combat. See [the HP page](hp.md) for more details.


## Ability scores

The intent is that the three *Ability* scores define skill in the three main
aspects of the game. Their distribution describes a character's skills; focused
on one for an expert and spread out for more flexible characters.

The scores are the following:
- [Physical Ability (PA)](physical-ability.md)
- [Mental Ability (MA)](mental-ability.md)
- [Organizational Ability (OA)](organizational-ability.md)


## Humanity (Hu)

The humanity stat describes how humane a character is on a scale from 1 to 10.
What these values mean and how one risks losing humanity is described in
[the Humanity page](humanity.md).


## Blood Potency (BP)

Blood Potency is the strength of your vampiric blood. The effects of this can be
seen in [the dedicated page](blood-potency.md).


## Powers

Among vampires these are often called powers or powers of the blood. They are
techniques through which blood can be used to influence the self or others.

See the [Powers of the Blood page](powers-of-the-blood.md) for a full listing
or the page for your character's [clan](clans.md) to see which ones are
immediately available for them.


## Influences

Influences allow vampires to affect human society, shaping the world to suit
their purposes. For a listing of the influences see the
[Influences page](influences.md), for a description of how influencing human
society works see the [Influence System page](influence-system.md).


## Calculated values

Optionally you are recommended to write down some calculated values:

- Unarmed Melee Damage:
  [PA](physical-ability.md) / 3 + levels in [Potence](potence.md)
- Significant Weapon Bonus:
  Bonus a weapon needs to provide to raise your damage by 1, which it does when
  your PA + bonus is evenly divisible by 3.


## Example sheet

Divided into character info first, then stats in their own table.
Thereafter one table follows for both [Powers](powers-of-the-blood.md) and
[Influences](influences.md).
