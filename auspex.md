### 1: Uncanny Perception

You can perceive primary emotions.

### 1: The Beast's Hackles

Your beast senses when something is wrong, when someone or something big is
hidden, but cannot tell you what. It exhibits as a feeling of being watched or
a sense of deja-vu.

### 2: The Spirit's Touch

By touching your victim you can more deeply read their thoughts, allowing you
to tell the reason for their primary emotion OR if they have lied to you in
this conversation.

### 2: See the Unseen

Your senses can pierce some illusions. For example you can see through level 1
Obfuscation and level 2 *if* weakened by movement, very recent interaction with
the environment (such as opening a door) or pointed out to you.

### 3: Lay Open the Mind

You restructure your thoughts until they align with your target, allowing a
quick touch to create a link to their mind. This link allows communication both
ways and makes it possible for you to try to overwhelm their mind and possibly
to reveal suppressed memories.

### 3: Pierce the Veil

Your senses can pierce most illusions. For example you can see through level 2
Obfuscation and level 3 *if* weakened by movement, very recent interaction with
the environment (such as opening a door) or pointed out to you.
