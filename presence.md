# Presence

#powers-of-the-blood

### 1: Awe

You can awe everyone who sees you, turning eyes to you and making what you say
weigh a little heavier than otherwise.

### 1: Shame

You can turn your charm against another, shaming them for something. If they have
less [Mental Ability](#mental-ability) than you they will feel guilty and
ashamed even if what you shamed them for was nonsense. "If you said it it must
be true."

### 2: Confidant

With a deep gaze you can charm a target with less
[Mental Ability](#mental-ability) than you to think of you as a trustworthy and
kind, making them more likely to entrust you with their secrets.

### 2: Obsession

With a touch you can embed an obsession in a target with less
[Mental Ability](#mental-ability) than you which remains for a week. Kindred
will think of you a few times per night, but there is no guarantee they will
think fondly of you, while humans generally think themselves to be in love and
can easily be manipulated to do anything that doesn't directly harm them.

### 3: Majesty

You can radiate such incredible awe that those in your presence with less
[Mental Ability](#mental-ability) than you cannot act beyond bowing to your
greatness or scurrying away.

### 3: Loyalty

You can inspire a deep and burning loyalty in a target with less
[Mental Ability](mental-ability.md) than you. Kindred see you as their liege and
are as loyal as a kindred can be for the night, humans are fully loyal for a
week and willing to give anything including their life to please you.
